    // diff between constructor and method is constructor name is same as class name
    // and no return type
    // Method name can be different and has return type
    // this is used to refer current object
    // Constructor is called when object is created
    // Constructor can be overloaded
    // If no constructor is defined, default constructor is provided by compiler
    // If constructor is defined, default constructor is not provided by compiler
    // Constructor can have parameters
    // Constructor is used to initialize the object
    // Constructor can call another constructor using this()
    // Constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, synchronized
    // Constructor can have access modifiers
    // Constructor cannot be inherited
    // Constructor can throw exceptions
    // Use this to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with same name

    // what are we doing in equals method explain line by line
    // 1. Check if the current object is the same as the object being compared
    // 2. Check if the object being compared is an instance of Employee
    // 3. Cast the object being compared to Employee
    // 4. Compare the id, name and email of both objects for equality
    // 5. Return true if all fields are equal, else return false
    // Why do we need to override equals and hashCode methods?
    // Because the default implementation of equals and hashCode methods in Object class
    // compares the memory addresses of the objects, which is not what we want
    // We want to compare the values of the fields of the objects for equality
    // When we override equals method, we must also override hashCode method
    // to maintain the contract between equals and hashCode methods
    // If two objects are equal according to equals method, they must have the same hash code
    // If two objects have the same hash code, they may or may not be equal according to equals method
    // Use Objects.equals() to compare the fields for null safety
    // Use instanceof to check the type of the object being compared
    // Use reference equality check to optimize performance
    // Handle null check in instanceof

        // because it fails for subclasses
        // instanceof works for subclasses also
        // is the equals method recommended way?
